# NUC-Dual-Bayesian-Inference-Models

This repository belongs to the research project conducted for my master thesis named 'Exploring the Naive Utility Calculus: A Computational Model for Action Understanding'.

This study is based upon an empirical padagogical study implementing the Naive Utility Caluclus (NUC):

'Young children consider the expected utility of others’ learning to decide what to teach' from Bridgers, Jara-Ettinger and Gweon (2020).

Our study utilises the original data and utility formula from Bridgers et al. (2020)'s behaviorual experiments to implement our own Naive Utility Calculus models. 

## Getting Started

To load the data and run all our models, run 

NUC_Dual_Bayesian_Inference_Main.Rmd. 

Running all chunks of the script also creates all relevant Tables and Figures 
belonging to my master thesis. 

## The Data

All data was taken from Bridgers et al. (2020)'s own study repository, available at: 

https://osf.io/wunbq/

All use of Bridgers et al. (2020)'s data and scripts was done for educational purposes only.

All data utilised for our own models can be found within \Data.

## The Models

All models can be accessed under \Models.

Full list of models:

  <li>Main Model: Dual Bayesian Inference Model</li>
  <li>Four Rewards Model</li>
  <li>Cost Model</li>
  <li>Discovery Difficulty Model</li>
